      Repair isn’t just about fixing things. It’s a mindset. One that quietly shapes how we respond to all kinds of breakage: emotional, material, and interpersonal. 

      This kit invites you to explore that idea by repairing something physical, and emotional, at the same time.

      The aim is to help you build a more compassionate relationship with repair itself, one that stays with you long after the object is mended.
